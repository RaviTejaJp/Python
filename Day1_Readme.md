# Github Setup

**Github** is a web based distributed verson control collabartion software. In normal words it is a software that facilitates collabarion between different developers or engineers when they are working on same code base.


## Github Account Creation

- Go to [Github]
- Signup to github if you don't have an account using your gmail id
- After creating an account create your first repository with some name.
> for this course I have created a public repo called "Python" under my account

> **Note**: I would suggest you to create a public repo for this course purpose. Later you can explore creating private repos and working with them once you are comfortable with github.

## Git Bash Setup

**GIT BASH** is a command line utility that can be use to interact with Github and also maintain local git repos. I would suggest that it is better to learn how to use git with command line so you can work across any OS flavour during your work assignments.

Download **GITBASH** for your respective os

| OS Flavour| Link |
|------ |------ |
| Windows | [WGBASH] |
| Linux   | [LGBASH] |
| MAC     | [MGBASH] |
